The data, their ETL code, and information about sources is available in a [Github repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data/). However, Google has gone further and made the COVID-19 data available as part of their [BigQuery Public Datasets Program](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-datasets/covid19-public-data-program). This means that we can use BigQuery to interact with the dataset using SQL-like queries, and these queries will be [free until September 15, 2021](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/publicly-available-covid-19-data-for-analytics).\n","\n","**ETL strategy**: in this notebook, we'll just use Google's [BigQuery Python libriary](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries#client-libraries-install-python) to query the data directly.
